Unlike previous approaches that use binary (Heaviside) functions for valve states, this model introduces a graded error term to capture varying degrees of valve malfunction, allowing for the simulation of backflow and pressure changes associated with conditions like mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation or stenosis. The model, implemented in Simulink, demonstrates that pressure and flow variations in the heartâ€™s chambers and vessels can serve as indicators of valve pathologies, and suggests that these hemodynamic signals could be correlated with non-invasive biosignals such as seismocardiograms (SCG) for early diagnosis. Future applications include enhancing non-invasive cardiac diagnostics, personalizing treatment strategies, and generating synthetic biosignals for machine learning, though direct SCG modeling was not realized in this work due to resource constraints.

This research emulates the function of valves and affects of valve malfunctions in the Cardiovascular System in MATLAB Simulink. A 6-compartment lumped parameter model that simulates the hemodynamics of the heart by focusing on valve aperture dynamics to better represent partial valve dysfunctions, regurgitation or stenosis. Due to valve dysfunctions, pressure in the atriums and ventricles change, which in turn affects the pressure change in the blood vessels. This study is performed to hint towards a correlation of pressure difference in blood vessels and valve malfunctions.
