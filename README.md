A list with description and images of all the projects that I have worked on


| Project | Start | End | Description | Result | Tech Stack | Files | Domain | 
|---------|-------|-----|-------------|--------|------------|-------|--------|
| [SlicerTracto](https://github.com/anoushkrit/SlicerTracto) | Dec 2024 | Ongoing | SlicerTracto is an open-source Slicer 3D extension tool which enables Neuro-Radiologists to visualize, localize, track and segment white matter tracts from Diffusion MRI scans all-in-one stand-alone desktop application. | SlicerTracto runs smoothly as a local extension over Slicer on all devices, Mac, Windows and Linux. Compute can also be transferred to servers.|  | | |
| [Talk2point](https://github.com/anoushkrit/talk2point) | Feb 2024| May 2024 | Modification in Tokenization of Changeit3D, on ShapeTalk dataset to make editing and generation more granular and region specific.| Using ShapeTalk dataset, we modified ChangeIt3D to learn more granular patch embeddings for text based point cloud reconstruction. SDFusion to reconstruct point clouds from scratch. | |||
| [MedIntel](https://github.com/satyam-kr03/MedIntel) | Feb 2024 | May 2024 | MedIntel is a chat bot finetuned to perform differential diagnosis using DDx-plus dataset by fine-tuning MedLLaVA (by Microsoft) and med-llama. These pre-trained models were fine-tuned on publicly-available MedQA and MedMCQA dataset. | MedIntel performs some differential diagnosis, i.e. across 49 common pathologies, with 110 symptoms listed in DDX plus dataset. Model was deployed on PARAM Himalaya (Super Computer at IIT Mandi) and inferred on basic Chat GUI using Streamlit. | |||
| [TractoGPT](https://github.com/anoushkrit/TractoGPT) | July 2024 | Nov 2024| TractoGPT models Tractography streamlines (3D point sequences) as 3D point clouds where we create patches of point clouds from a bigger point cloud. Patches are encoded as tokens to pretrain GPT on point cloud reconstruction task using dual-masking, which can further fine-tuned for downstream tasks like classification, segmentation etc.| Outperformed Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab, University of Sherbrooke, Canada(SCIL)'s work, FIESTA. Published in International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging. | |||
| [TrackletGPT](https://github.com/anoushkrit/TrackletGPT)| Jan 2025 | Ongoing | An upgrade on TractoGPT, where we are modifying the point cloud token. Here token resembles a bspline which is a part of streamline. | Results on how it performs are still pending.||||
